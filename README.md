# Diamond Price Predication

The Diamond Price Prediction project is an end-to-end machine learning initiative designed to forecast the prices of diamonds. Diamonds are highly valuable gemstones, and their prices can vary significantly based on various factors. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions of diamond prices, thereby offering valuable insights to both buyers and sellers in the diamond market.



## Understanding the Dataset

The first step in any ML project is acquiring and understanding the dataset. For our diamond price prediction project, we have a dataset containing several variables:

    1. Carat: The weight of the diamond.
    2. Depth: The depth of the diamond in terms of its dimensions.
    3. Table: The width of the diamond's top face as a percentage of its average diameter.
    4. x, y, z: Dimensions of the diamond.
    5. Cut: The quality of the diamond's cut.
    6. Color: The color grade of the diamond.
    7. Clarity: The clarity grade of the diamond.
Our goal is to use these features to predict the price of the diamond accurately.


## Data Preprocessing:
Before feeding the data into our ML model, we need to preprocess it. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (like Cut, Color, and Clarity), and scaling numerical features. Additionally, we might perform feature engineering to create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.

## Model Selection and Training:
Once the data is preprocessed, we can proceed to select an appropriate ML algorithm for our task.
The algorithm used for trained the models are:-
1. Linear regression
2. Lasso regression
3. Ridge regression
4. Elasticnet regression
5. Decision Tress
